## Syntax of Markdown
This section is prepared by Jingang Chen, an undergraduate junior pursuing  a 
dual degree in computer science and statistical data science.

This section will focus on the syntax of Markdown, which is a lightweight 
markup language that allows to user to write content in plain text format, 
which can be rendered to various formats like HTML and PDF, and is widely used 
in open-source documentation.

### Headers
In markdown, creating heading levels for sections and subsections are denoted 
by `#` (atx-style) in the beginning of the line. The number of hashtags denote 
the heading level, with more hashtags indicating smaller heading levels. 
There are a total of 6 heading levels using the hashtags.

```markdown
# Header 1 (Main)
## Header 2 (Subheading)
### Header 3 (Subheading)
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

> A space is required after the hashtags to denote that it is a heading

Headings can also be denoted by using underlined `=` and `-` signs, though this 
will only work for the first and second level headers respectively.

```markdown
Header 1
===
Header 2
----
```
Any amount of `=` and `-` signs will work to create those top two headings.

### Paragraph and Line Break Convention
To seperate text into paragraphs, make sure there is at least one blank space 
between the blocks of texts.

```markdown
This is the first pargraph which can contain multiple lines, and as long there
is no blank line in this, then this block of text is one paragraph.

This is an example of a second paragraph. This one is seperated by a blank line
from the paragraph above to denote a different paragraph.
```
**Output**:

This is the first pargraph which can contain multiple lines, and as long there
is no blank line in this, then this block of text is one paragraph.

This is an example of a second paragraph. This one is seperated by a blank line
from the paragraph above to denote a different paragraph.

- - -

To create a line break within a paragraph, end whatever line you're on with two
spaces, then press enter/return to start a new line. The break tag `<br>` is 
also sufficient.

```markdown
This is one line.  
This is a line that is seperated from the line above using two spaces <br>
This is a third line seperated using the `<br>` break tag
```
**Output:**

This is one line.  
This is another line that is seperated from the line above. <br>
This is a third line seperated using the `<br>` break tag

> `<>` in Markdown is a HTML tag, which is another way to structure the
document

### Text Formatting

#### Bolding and Italics
*Italic* text, uses single asterisks (*) or underscores (_) around the text, 
while **bold** text uses double asterisks or underscores. To make the text both 
***bolded and italicized***, put three asterisks or underscores around the text.

|                  Syntax                            | Output                |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `*Italicized*` <br> `_Italicized_`                 | _Italicized_          |
| `**Bolded**` <br> `__Bolded__`                     |  **Bolded**           |
| `***bold & italics***` <br> ` ___bold & italics___`| ***bolded & italics***|

Emphasis can also be placed within a word as well, but only `*` can be used, 
not `_`.

|                  Syntax              |            Output                   |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|`s*uperfragalis*t ex**pialidociou**s` | s*uperfragalis*t ex**pialidociou**s |

#### Strikethrough
Strikethrough uses `~~` around the text to cross it out.

|     Syntax              |         Output         |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
|`~~strikethrough text~~` | ~~strikethrough text~~ |

#### Superscript and Subscript
To superscript, use `^` around the desired text.

For subscript, use `~` around the desired text.

|   Syntax       |   Output       |
|----------------|----------------|
|`superscript^2^`| superscript^2^ |
|`subscript~2~`  | subscript~2~   |

#### Underlining and Highlighting
To underline, bracket the desired text with `[]`, and then follow that using 
`{.underline}`.

To highlight, bracket the desired text with `[]`, and follow that using 
`{.mark}`. Alternatively you can start the text with `<mark>` and end it with 
`</mark>`.

|                  Syntax                     |      Output                   |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|`[underlined text]{.underline}`              | [underlined text]{.underline} |
|`[highlighted]{.mark}` <br> `<mark>higlighted</mark>` | [highlighted]{.mark} |

### Lists

Lists and nested lists can be structured in Markdown either unordered or 
ordered. For nested lists, make sure to include 4 spaces to properly indent the 
nested list (applies to both ordered and unordered).

#### Unordered Lists
For unordered lists, `*`, `+`, or `-` can be used to make a list.

```markdown
* Item 1
    * Subitem
        * Another subitem
* Item 2
* Item 3
```
and

```markdown
+ Item 1
   + Subitem
       + Another subitem
+ Item 2
+ Item 3
```

and 

```markdown
- Item 1
   - Subitem
       - Another subitem
- Item 2
- Item 3
```
as well a mix of all three:

```markdown
* Item 1
   + Subitem
       - Another subitem
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

all yield the same output:

* Item 1
   + Subitem
       - Another subitem
* Item 2
* Item 3

#### Ordered Lists
Ordered lists use numbers with periods.

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
    1. Sub item
3. Item 3
```
The numbers don't necessarily have to be ordered, and they can be duplicated as
well. Whatever number the list starts on will be the one that it will count from
no matter the numbers that come after it.

```markdown
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
    1. Sub Item
1. Item 3
```

```markdown
1. Item 1
4. Item 2
    2. Sub Item
7. Item 3
```
All three of these lists will yield the same result:

1. Item 1
4. Item 2
    1. Sub Item
7. Item 3

However, if the list were to start on 2, it would start counting from 2 no 
matter the order that follows.

```markdown
2. Item 1
2. Item 2
5. Item 3
```
**Output:**

2. Item 1
2. Item 2
5. Item 3

#### Task List
To denote the lists as a series of tasks, use `- [ ]`, which is unchecked, 
and ` [x]`, which is checked, at the beginning of the line.

```markdown
- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
```
**Output:**

- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2

#### Definition lists
Defintion lists can be created with the following convention:

```markdown
term
: defintion

term2
: definition2
```
Output:

term
: defintion

term2
: definition2

#### Some Additional Notes About Lists
There are some additional features that can be done with the lists mentioned.

A list can continue after a break in between. For ordered lists, the numbering
still follows through after an interruption.

```markdown
1. Item 1

interruption text

2. Item 2
```
**Output:**

1. Item 1

interruption text

2. Item 2

Text than isn't numbered or in bullet points can also be added below list using
four spaces for indenting. Code chunks can be added in this case as well.

```markdown
1. ordered list
2. item 2
    continued after indenting 4 spaces
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
    A. sub-sub-item 1
```

**Output:**

1. ordered list
2. item 2

    continued after indenting 4 spaces
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
   A.  sub-sub-item 1
### Code

#### Inline Code
Markdown allows for inline code and code blocks.

To insert inline code, use the backticks `` ` `` around the text

```markdown
This is an example of `inline code` in a text.
```
**Output**: This is an example of `inline code` in a text.

To display the `` ` `` as part of an inline code, surround the character with 
` `` ` backticks and spacing them apart from `` ` ``.

#### Code Blocks
To create code blocks, ` ``` ` can be used.

```
    ```
    some code
    ```
```
Output:

```
some code
```

Alternatively, code blocks can be indented by identing four or more spaces
prior to the code.

    This is code using the indentation of four spaces
        This line has more than four spaces

A language can also be added to specify the language of the code blocks if
` ``` ` is used.

    ```python
    print('some python code')
    ```

**Output**:

```python
print('some python code')
```

To make the code executable, put `{}` around the syntax language being used in
the code blocks.

```python
    ```{{python}}
    print("Some python code")
    ```
```

**Output**:
```{python}
print('some python code')
```

### Link Embedding
Links in Markdown can either be added inline or as a reference.

To add an **inline link**, use `[]` around the text that leads to the link, 
followed by actually inputting the link in `()`.

```markdown
this is an example link that will lead to the 
[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
```
**Output:** : This is an example link that will lead to the 
[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

Alternatively, for inline links, the URL can be directly added without linking 
it to text by just using `<>` around the URL.

```markdown
Link to <https://www.markdownguide.org/>.
```
**Output:** Link to <https://www.markdownguide.org/>.

For reference-style links, you can having text linked to the URL and a seperate 
number or text that points to the link with `[]`

```markdown
Example of reference-style link leading to the [Markdown Guide][link].

[link]: https://www.markdownguide.org
```
**Output:**

Example of reference-style link leading to the [Markdown Guide][link].

[link]: https://www.markdownguide.org/

### Images

To insert an image into markdown, the convention is to first add `!`, followed 
by a caption to the image wrapped in `[]`, and finally the file path or URL to 
the image enclosed with `()`.

In addition, the image can be embedded with a link by first wrapping the 
3 parameters mentioned above in `[]`, followed by the link wrapped in `()`.

```markdown
[![UConn Husky Logo](C:\Users\jinga\Downloads\uconnlogo.png)](https://uconn.edu/)
```
Output:

[![UConn Husky Logo](C:\Users\jinga\Downloads\uconnlogo.png)](https://uconn.edu/)

### Tables

To create tables, the `|` character is used to seperate the table into columns,
while the `-` is used to seperate the headers of the table from the rest of the 
data.

```markdown
| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 | Col 4 |
|------|-----|----------|-------|
|   a  |  b  |    c     |  d    |
|  e   |  f  |  g       |  h    |
|   i  |   j |    k     |    l  |
```
Output:

| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 | Col 4 |
|------|-----|----------|-------|
|   a  |  b  |    c     |  d    |
|  e   |  f  |  g       |  h    |
|   i  |   j |    k     |    l  |

Columns can also be aligned to the left, right or center by add a colong `:` to
the left, right or on both sides of the `-`'s of the table.

```markdown
| Right Col | Left Col | Center | Default |
|----------:|:---------|:------:|---------|
|        a  |       b  |    c   |    d    |
|  e        |       f  |   g    |    h    |
|   i       |        j |  k     |      l  |
```
Output:

| Right Col | Left Col | Center | Default |
|----------:|:---------|:------:|---------|
|        a  |       b  |    c   |    d    |
|  e        |       f  |   g    |    h    |
|   i       |        j |  k     |      l  |
