## Syntax of Markdown
This section is prepared by Jingang Chen, an undergraduate junior pursuing  a 
dual degree in computer science and statistical data science.

This section will focus on the syntax of Markdown, which is a  lightweight 
markup language that allows to user to write content in plain text format, 
which can be rendered to various formats like HTML and PDF, and is widely used 
in open-source documentation.

### Headers
In markdown, creating heading levels for sections and subsections are denoted 
by `#` (atx-style) in the beginning of the line. The number of hashtags denote 
the heading level, with more hashtags indicating smaller heading levels. 
There are a total of 6 heading levels using the hashtags.

```markdown
# Header 1 (Main)
## Header 2 (Subheading)
### Header 3 (Subheading)
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

> A space is required after the hashtags to denote that it is a heading

Headings can also be denoted by using underlined `=` and `-` signs, though this 
will only work for the first and second level headers respectively.

```markdown
Header 1
===
Header 2
----
```
Any amount of `=` and `-` signs will work to create those top two headings.

## Paragraph and Line Break Convention
To seperate text into paragraphs, make sure there is at least one blank space 
between the blocks of texts.

```markdown
This is the first pargraph which can contain multiple lines, and as long there
is no blank line in this, then this block of text is one paragraph.

This is an example of a second paragraph. This one is seperated by a blank line
from the paragraph above to denote a different paragraph.

To create a line break within a paragraph, end whatever line you're on with two
spaces, then press enter/return to start a new line.

```markdown
This is one line.  
This is another line that is seperated from the line above.
```
